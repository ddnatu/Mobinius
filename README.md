 Not much focus has been given to the UI part as time was running out, would have try to replicate it given the time.
 
 I have consumed the service by locally hosting tech.json (http://localhost:8080/tech.json, but no results are displayed, but i have consoled them, you can check in console.
 
 Also all business logic and validations i have also consoled, you can again check it in console.
 
 Moreover i tried to implement React Router in the given span of time but was unable to do so, i can try and consolidate all of this given some more time as this react.js requirement was a little strange to me, i tried my best and will be able to answer all the steps i did along the assignment.
 
 Please do check the code and assess it logically.
